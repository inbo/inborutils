\title{Query recording (releve) information from INBOVEG}
\usage{
inboveg_recordings(connection, survey_name, collect = FALSE,
  multiple = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{survey_name}{A character string or a character vector, depending on
multiple parameter, giving the name or names of the
survey(s) for which you want to extract releve information. If missing, all
surveys are returned.}

\item{connection}{dbconnection with the database 'Cydonia'
on the inbo-sql07-prd server}

\item{collect}{If FALSE (the default), a remote tbl object is returned.
This is like a reference to the result of the query but the full result of
the query is not brought into memory. If TRUE the full result of the query is
collected (fetched) from the database and brought into memory of the working
environment.}

\item{multiple}{If TRUE, survey_name can take a character vector with
multiple survey names that must match exactly. If FALSE (the default),
survey_name must be a single character string (one survey name) that can
include wildcarts to allow partial matches}
}
\value{
A remote tbl object (collect = FALSE) or a tibble dataframe (collect
= TRUE) with variables RecordingGivid (uniek Id), LayerCode, CoverCode,
OriginalName, ScientificName, PhenologyCode, CoverageCode, PctValue
(percentage coverage), RecordingScale (name of the scale of coverage)
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#defunct}{\figure{lifecycle-defunct.svg}{options: alt='[Defunct]'}}}{\strong{[Defunct]}}
This function queries the INBOVEG database for
releve information (which species were recorded in which plots and in which
vegetation layers with which cover) for one or more surveys.
