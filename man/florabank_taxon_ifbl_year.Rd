\title{Get unique combinations of taxon, IFBL-square and year.}
\usage{
florabank_taxon_ifbl_year(connection, starting_year = 2010,
  ifbl_resolution = c("1km-by-1km", "4km-by-4km"),
  taxongroup = c("Vaatplanten", "Mossen", "Lichenen (korstmossen)",
  "Kranswieren"), collect = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{connection}{A connection to the florabank database. See the example section
for how to connect and disconnect to the database.}

\item{starting_year}{Filter for observations that start from this year onwards.
Default is 2010.}

\item{ifbl_resolution}{The requested spatial resolution can be either
1km-by-1km IFBL squares or 4km-by-4km. Default is 1km-by-1km.}

\item{taxongroup}{Choose for which taxonomic group you want the unique
combinations. One of "Vaatplanten" (the default), "Mossen", "Korstmossen"
of "Kranswieren".}

\item{collect}{If FALSE (the default), a remote tbl object is returned. This
is like a reference to the result of the query but the full result of the
query is not brought into memory. If TRUE the full result of the query is
collected (fetched) from the database and brought into memory of the working
environment.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with one line for each combination of taxon, IFBL-square
(either at 1 km x 1 km or 4 km x 4 km resolution) and year. In case the
resolution is 1 km x 1 km, a variable ifbl_4by4 gives the corresponding
ifbl_4by4 identifier within which the ifbl_1by1 square is located. In case the
resolution is 4 km x 4 km, the variable ifbl_squares is a concatenation of
all nested squares with observations for the taxon in the corresponding year.
This can be nested 1 x 1 squares as well as the corresponding 4 x 4 square
(the latter is the case if the original resolution of the observation is at
4 x 4 resolution). In addition, the variable ifbl_number_squares gives the
number of unique nested squares where the taxon was observed for that year
and 4 x 4 square combination.
}
\description{
This functions queries all validated observations of the florabank database
and returns unique combinations of taxon, IFBL-square and year. Either a 1 km
by 1 km or a 4 km x 4 km resolution can be chosen and a begin year can be set.
Observations of taxa at genus level or higher are excluded. The taxonomic
group can be chosen.
