\title{Query classification information from INBOVEG}
\usage{
inboveg_classification(connection, survey_name, classif, collect = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{survey_name}{A character vector giving the names of the surveys for
which you want to extract Classification information. If missing, all
surveys are returned.}

\item{classif}{A character vector giving the Classification code of the
vegetation type for which you want to extract information. If missing,
all classifications are returned.}

\item{connection}{dbconnection with the database 'Cydonia'
on the inbo-sql07-prd server}

\item{collect}{If FALSE (the default), a remote tbl object is returned. This
is like a reference to the result of the query but the full result of the
query is not brought into memory. If TRUE the full result of the query is
collected (fetched) from the database and brought into memory of the working
environment.}
}
\value{
A remote tbl object (collect = FALSE) or a tibble dataframe (collect
= TRUE) with variables Id, SurveyName, Classification-code, BWK or
N2000-list, LocalClassification, Description of the Habitattype, Cover-code,
Cover in percentage.

This function queries the INBOVEG database for information
on the field classification (N2000 or BWK-code) of the releve (recording) for one
or more survey(s) by the name of the survey. See the examples
for how to get information for all surveys.
